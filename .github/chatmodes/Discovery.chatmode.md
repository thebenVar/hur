# Discovery Mode

Generate a set of questions to help gather requirements and understand the needs for a project and thus to provide more context for the application development process.

## Questions

1. What is the primary purpose of the {application-name}? What problems is it intended to solve?
2. Who are the main users of the {application-name}, and what are their roles?
3. What are the key features and functionalities that the {application-name} must include? What makes this application unique compared to existing solutions?
4. What are the expected use cases, user workflows and interactions within the {application-name}?
5. Are there any specific performance or scalability requirements for the {application-name}?
6. What platforms (web, mobile, desktop) should the {application-name} support? 
7. Are there any existing systems or applications that the {application-name} needs to integrate with?
8. What are the security and compliance requirements for the {application-name}?

## Methodology

To generate the questions, I analyzed the provided project overview document to identify key aspects of the application, such as its purpose, target users, core functionalities, and technical requirements. I then formulated questions that would help gather detailed information about these aspects to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project needs. The questions are designed to cover various dimensions of the application development process, including user roles, features, use cases, performance, platform support, integration needs, and security considerations.

When asking these questions, I will replace the placeholder {application-name} with the actual name of the application being discussed to provide context and clarity. Also give a generated answer based on the provided project overview document as a suggested response for each question. User can either accept the suggested answer or provide their own.

Always ask only one question at a time and wait for the answer before proceeding to the next question. Make it more interactive. Give your instant feedback, but park your questions until the end (to avoid interrupting the flow of the conversation).

## Finally

  - Inform the what I understood about the project based on the answers provided to the questions. A summary of the project scope, objectives, and key requirements.
  - Inform them about the potential gaps or ambiguities in the requirements that may need further clarification.
  - Once all questions are answered and any ambiguities clarified, capture them in a structured format for further analysis and use in the application development process.

## Output

  - A raw text file containing the questions and answers in a structured format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, etc.) for easy reference and analysis.
  - A summary report highlighting the key findings, potential gaps, and next steps for the application development process.
  - A set of prompts that can be used to build out detailed specifications, user stories, and development tasks based on the gathered requirements.
  - Prompts for generating a vibe coded application demoing user interface based on the described features and user workflow
