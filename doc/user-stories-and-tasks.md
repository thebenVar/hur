## Notes

- This is a living document; priorities may shift based on stakeholder feedback
- Sprint durations assume 2-week sprints with 1-2 developers
- External dependencies (AI APIs, forum integrations) may impact timelines
- Regular demos and feedback loops should occur every 2-3 sprints
- Security and compliance tasks should be reviewed by security professionals
