# Internship Project Proposal

## Project Title
**HURAI: AI-Powered Helpdesk with Unified Response System**

## Abstract
hurAI (Helpdesk with a Unified Response) is an innovative support management platform designed to revolutionize how organizations handle technical support requests. The system aggregates communications from multiple channels (WhatsApp, Email, Phone, and Internal messaging) into a single unified interface, eliminating the inefficiencies of context-switching between different tools. What sets hurAI apart is its intelligent AI integration that assists support agents with real-time call transcription, automated ticket analysis, sentiment detection, and knowledge base recommendations. The platform not only streamlines ticket management but also builds organizational intelligence by identifying training gaps, tracking process adherence, and revealing insights about supported applications and resources. This 3-month internship project will focus on developing a Proof-of-Concept (POC) version featuring core functionalities including the unified dashboard with real-time metrics, multi-channel message feed, comprehensive ticket management system with action points tracking, basic AI-powered features (call recording analysis and KB suggestions), role-based access control, and essential security measures. The project offers hands-on experience with modern web technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS), AI/ML integration, database design, and real-world software development practices, making it an excellent opportunity for students to build a full-stack application that addresses genuine business challenges in the support services domain.

## Project Scope for 3-Month Internship (4-5 Students)

### Objectives
- Develop a functional POC of the HUR platform
- Implement core features: unified dashboard, ticket management, and basic AI integration
- Deploy a working demo for stakeholder review
- Document the system architecture and development process

### Deliverables
1. **Functional Web Application** with responsive design
2. **Database Schema** and data models
3. **Authentication & Authorization** system with role-based access
4. **Core Features**:
   - Unified message feed
   - Manual ticket creation and management
   - Real-time dashboard with key metrics
   - Action points and activity log tracking
   - Basic knowledge base integration
   - Audio upload for call recordings (mock AI analysis)
5. **Technical Documentation** including API documentation and deployment guide
6. **Final Presentation** demonstrating the working system

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
